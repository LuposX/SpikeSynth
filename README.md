## üöÄ Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LuposX/SpikeSynth.git
cd SpikeSynth
````

### Using Nix

You can use Nix to install the required Python packages and enter a development shell:

```sh
nix develop
```

### Using Pip

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies globally with Pip:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üß© Usage

### Surrogate

To create the surrogate model, navigate to the `surrogate` folder.
Place your **SPIKE data** for the circuit you want to simulate into the `data` directory.

1. Use the notebook `1_create_surrogate_dataset.ipynb` to generate the dataset for training the surrogate model.
   The resulting dataset will be saved as `data/dataset.ds`.
2. Use `2_tain_gpt_surrogate.py` to train the baseline GPT surrogate model, or `2_train_rsnn_surrogate.py` to train the RSNN surrogate model.
   Logging requires a **Weights & Biases (wandb)** account.
3. To perform hyperparameter optimization, run:

   ```sh
   python 3_hyperparameter_search_rsnn.py
   ```

#### Running Hyperparameter Search on a Cluster

If you want to run the hyperparameter search on a cluster system that uses **SLURM**, you can use the file `slurm_sweep.sh` in the `surrogate` folder.

1. Edit the script to adjust the task parameters to your requirements.

2. Submit the job:

   ```sh
   sbatch slurm_sweep.sh
   ```

3. To see an estimate of when your job will start:

   ```sh
   squeue --start -j <job-id>
   ```

4. To view your running jobs:

   ```sh
   squeue -u $USER
   ```

All SLURM logs will be stored in the `logs_slurm` directory.


### pLSNN

To create the full pLSNN model, use the notebook:

```sh
train_pRSNN.ipynb
```

* To include **variation**, switch `exp_pSNN_lP.py` to `exp_pSNN_var_lP.py`.
* To reproduce the **baseline approach** from [1], switch `exp_pSNN_lP.py` to `exp_pSNN.py`.
  In this case, you‚Äôll need to train a separate surrogate model within the `surrogate_baseline` directory.
